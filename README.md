How to (read to end, then start doing it):
- download ReiNX-Custom-Splash-Converter-Release-0.1.zip from the RELEASE tab (not Source Code)

- start the .exe you just unzipped
- click "select image" and select the image you want as splash

the image you need to select needs to be in the proprtion of:
VERTICAL
AND NOT
HORIZONTAL
Rotate it with your favorite image software (paint, photoshop, gimp, you name it)

- copy the splash.bin (which you can find in the same directory as the .exe you started!) to the /ReiNX/ folder

- inject payload
- be amazed by the splash (or not, if you didnt rotate the image to the left 90Â°)
Have fun :)
