# ReiNX-Custom-Splash-Converter
Tool that converts images to a splash.bin

Inspired by: https://github.com/TheExpertNoob/Custom-Splash-Script-for-ReiNX

Requirements:
- ReiNX (or any other CFW that can display splash.bin ==> only tested with ReiNX)
- .net Framework
- Windows
- image (in the Dimensions 720x1280 ==> because the image will be roated 90° to the left on the switch)
(That means you need to rotate your splash-image (thats normally horizontally) 90° to left (it should look like vertically now)
